# TechCrunch

This Next.js application is a recreation of the TechCrunch website, leveraging their WordPress CMS as a data
source. Built entirely using the newest Next.js App Router and its feature-set, the project highlights a focus on
performance and rendering strategies.

## Getting Started

### Prompt

Please develop an application and deploy it on Vercel. This app will be used to demo your knowledge of the Vercel
platform, so use as many Vercel/Next features as needed to aid your demo. Put particular focus on front-end performance,
using appropriate Next.js rendering strategies, while also demonstrating your technical strengths. This should typically
be a new project specifically built for this stage of the interview, but if you’ve built something suitable within the
past 1-2 months, please let us know and we can consider using that as well. If you’re looking for a good starting point,
feel free to use our Vercel Commerce 2.0 template. Please submit this in 5-7 days, or let us know if you need more time.

### Development mode

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

### Production mode

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run build
pnpm run start
```

Your app should be up and running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)!
