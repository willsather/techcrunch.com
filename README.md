# TechCrunch Demo

## Prompt

Please develop an application and deploy it on Vercel. This app will be used to demo your knowledge of the Vercel
platform, so use as many Vercel/Next features as needed to aid your demo. Put particular focus on front-end performance,
using appropriate Next.js rendering strategies, while also demonstrating your technical strengths. 

This should typically be a new project specifically built for this stage of the interview, but if you’ve built something 
suitable within the past 1-2 months, please let us know and we can consider using that as well. 

## Deep Dive

#### Introduction

This Next.js application is a recreation of the TechCrunch website, leveraging their WordPress CMS as a data
source. Built entirely using the newest Next.js App Router and its feature-set, the project highlights a focus on
performance and rendering strategies.

#### Technologies Overview

* **Framework**: Next.js App Router
* **Platform**: Vercel
* **Dependency**: `pnpm`
* **UI**: Radix, shadcn/ui, Sonner
* **Other**: React Hook Form, Zod

#### Next.js Rendering Strategies

○ (Static) (`/startups`, `/apps`/, `/venture`, etc)
  * Always pre-rendered during build

ƒ (Dynamic) (`/latest`)
  * Always server-rendered on request

● (SSG) (`/posts/[slug]`)
  * Either pre-rendered during build **_OR_** rendered on request

#### Vercel Differentiators

* Efficient Rendering (Caching, ISR)
* Observability Rendering (Analytics, Speed Insights, Logs)
* Git Integration (Automated Deployments, PR Preview)
* Security (Firewall, DDoS Insights, Challenge Mode)
* Automated Rollback (Cache, Skew Protection)

#### Development/Deployment Differences from Other Platforms/Approaches

##### Development
* `create-react-app`: Client Side Rendering (_also deprecated_)

* `remix`: Bigger ecosystem/community, platform/framework integrations

* `astro`: Full server Side Rendering support, handle complex web applications

##### Deployment

###### WordPress
* Performance
* No Bulky Backend / Database
* Flexible Content Management Options

###### Self Hosting
* Automated Deployments / Rollbacks
* Out of the Box Features
  * Edge Delivery (CDN & Compute)
  * Analytics


## Getting Started

### Development mode

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

### Production mode

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run build
pnpm run start
```

Your app should be up and running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)!
