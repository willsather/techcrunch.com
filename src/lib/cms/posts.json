Andreessen dreams of making a16z a lasting company, beyond partnerships"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Many venture industry observers <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https:\/\/www.theinformation.com\/articles\/why-andreessen-horowitz-might-go-public?rc=em6blq\">have wondered<\/a> whether Andreessen Horowitz, a firm that <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https:\/\/a16z.com\/about\/\">manages $45 billion<\/a>, has its sights on eventually becoming a publicly traded company.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Co-founder Marc Andreessen said he isn&#8217;t &#8220;chomping at the bit to take the firm public,&#8221; on this week&#8217;s <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https:\/\/podcasts.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/marc-andreessen-the-battle-for-tech-supremacy\/id1154105909?i=1000691052043\">Invest Like the Best podcast<\/a>. But he discussed his goal of building a16z into an enduring company, drawing inspiration from JP Morgan and publicly traded private equity firms.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Historically, venture capital firms have been partnerships consisting of a &#8220;small tribe of people sitting in a room together, trying to bounce ideas off of each other when they make investments,&#8221; Andreessen said on the podcast.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The problem with the partnership model, he said, is that it\u2019s highly dependent on the ideas and expertise of those people at the table with \u201cno underlying asset value,\u201d as he described it. Once the original partners retire, the firm loses a lot of its value, even if a new generation of investors takes over.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">&#8220;But even if they can keep it going, there&#8217;s no underlying asset value. That next generation is just going to have to hand it off to the third generation,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That&#8217;s probably going to fail on the third generation. It&#8217;s going to be on Wikipedia someday: that firm existed, and then it went away.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The partnership model can be lucrative. A16z\u2019s billions under management generates sizable money management fees for the firm, in addition to profits made when its investments succeed.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, Andreessen said he constantly reminds internal staff and limited partners that the company isn\u2019t raising money just to harvest the fees. It\u2019s to give the company the cash to invest in growing companies.<\/p>\n<div class=\"marfeel-experience-inline-cta wp-block-tc23-marfeel-experience\">\n<\/div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">&#8220;When we go for scale, it&#8217;s because we think it&#8217;s necessary to support the kinds of companies we want to help our founders build,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Andreessen says his bigger goal for a16z is to create a company that lasts. An alternative to a partnership is to build an investment company that&#8217;s managed like a business, which means it has management, multiple layers of staff, division of labor with specializations, and training programs, Andreessen said.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There are certainly precedents of small partnerships evolving into large corporations, which Andreessen can use as a model for a16z&#8217;s ambitions.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">&#8220;Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan, 100 years ago, looked like little venture capital firms,&#8221; he said.\u00a0&#8220;Then their leaders, over time, turned them into huge franchises and big public companies.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He named other examples, too, of private partnerships turned into large publicly traded companies like big private equity firms. Blackstone, which now has a market capitalization of over $200 billion, went public in 2007. Apollo, KKR, and Carlyle held their IPOs soon after Blackstone, and TPG listed on Nasdaq in early 2022.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Andreessen argues that as these companies grew from partnerships into large corporations, their long-term success became less dependent on a few key investors.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">&#8220;A big part of what we&#8217;ve been trying to do is build something that has that kind of enduring aspect to it,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In many ways, Andreessen Horowitz already looks more like an operating company than many VC firms. A16z has dozens of people in its marketing group and large teams that help portfolio companies recruit talent and sell their products. The firm runs separate crypto, bio and health, and American dynamism strategies.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But maybe there\u2019s another reason Andreessen is keen to restructure away from the classic VC system. When it comes to partnerships, he says, &#8220;It actually turns out in most cases, what you discover is that people actually don&#8217;t like each other that much.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Many venture industry observers have wondered whether Andreessen Horowitz, a firm that manages $45 billion, has its sights on eventually becoming a publicly traded company.

Officials were said to be leaning on Apple to create a &#8220;backdoor&#8221; in the service that would allow state actors to access data in the clear.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The U.K. has had sweeping powers to limit technology firms&#8217; use of strong encryption since passing a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/11\/29\/yes-the-uk-now-has-a-law-to-log-web-users-browsing-behavior-hack-devices-and-limit-encryption\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">2016 update to state surveillance powers<\/a>. According to reporting by the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/technology\/2025\/02\/07\/apple-encryption-backdoor-uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Washington Post<\/a>, U.K. officials have used the Investigatory Powers Act (IPA) to place the demand on Apple \u2014 seeking &#8220;blanket&#8221; access to data that its iCloud Advanced Data Protection (ADP) service is designed to protect from third-party access, including Apple itself.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The technical architecture of Apple&#8217;s ADP service has been designed in such a way that even the tech giant does not hold encryption keys \u2014 thanks to the use of <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2025\/01\/31\/techcrunch-reference-guide-to-security-terminology\/#end-to-end-encryption\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">end-to-end encryption (E2EE)<\/a> \u2014 allowing Apple to promise it has &#8220;zero knowledge&#8221; of its users&#8217; data.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2025\/01\/31\/techcrunch-reference-guide-to-security-terminology\/#backdoor\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">backdoor<\/a> is a term typically deployed to describe a secret vulnerability inserted into code to circumvent, or otherwise undermine, security measures in order to enable third parties. In the iCloud case, the order allows U.K. intelligence agents or law enforcement to gain access to users&#8217; encrypted data.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the U.K. government routinely refuses to confirm or deny reports of notices issued under the IPA, security experts have warned that such a secret order <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2025\/02\/10\/uks-secret-apple-icloud-backdoor-order-is-a-global-emergency-say-critics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">could have global ramifications<\/a> if the iPhone maker is forced to weaken security protections it offers to all users, including those located outside the United Kingdom.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Once a vulnerability in software exists, there is a risk that it could be exploited by other types of agents, say hackers and other bad actors wanting to gain access for nefarious purposes \u2014 such as identity theft, or to acquire and sell sensitive data, or even to deploy ransomware.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This may explain why the predominant phrasing used around state-driven attempts to gain access to E2EE is this visual abstraction of a backdoor; asking for a <em>vulnerability<\/em> to be <em>intentionally<\/em> added to code makes the trade-offs plainer.<\/p>\n<div class=\"marfeel-experience-inline-cta wp-block-tc23-marfeel-experience\">\n<\/div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To use an example: When it comes to physical doors \u2014 in buildings, walls, or the like \u2014 it is never guaranteed that only the property&#8217;s owner or key holder will have exclusive use of that point of entry.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Once an opening exists, it creates a potential for access \u2014 someone could obtain a copy of the key, for example, or even force their way in by breaking the door down.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The bottom line: There is no perfectly selective doorway that exists to let only a particular person pass through. If someone can enter, it logically follows that someone else might be able to use the door too.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The same access risk principle applies to vulnerabilities added to software (or, indeed, hardware).<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The concept of <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/NOBUS\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">NOBUS<\/a> (&#8220;nobody but us&#8221;) backdoors has been floated by security services in the past. This specific kind of backdoor typically rests on an assessment of their technical capabilities to exploit a particular vulnerability being superior to all others \u2014 essentially an ostensibly more-secured backdoor that can only be exclusively accessed by their own agents.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But by very nature, technology prowess and capability is a movable feat. Assessing the technical capabilities of unknown others is also hardly an exact science. The &#8220;NOBUS&#8221; concept sits on already questionable assumptions; any third-party access creates the risk of opening up fresh vectors for attack, such as social engineering techniques aimed at targeting the person with the &#8220;authorized&#8221; access.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unsurprisingly, many security experts dismiss NOBUS as a fundamentally flawed idea. Simply put, any access creates risk; therefore, pushing for backdoors is antithetical to strong security.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yet, regardless of these clear and present security concerns, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/09\/03\/five-eyes-governments-call-on-tech-giants-to-build-encryption-backdoors-or-else\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">governments continue pressing for backdoors<\/a>. Which is why we keep having to talk about them.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The term &#8220;backdoor&#8221; also implies that such requests can be clandestine, rather than public \u2014 just as backdoors aren&#8217;t public-facing entry points. In Apple&#8217;s iCloud case, a request to compromise encryption made under the U.K.&#8217;s IPA \u2014 by way of a &#8220;technical capability notice,&#8221; or TCN \u2014 cannot be legally disclosed by the recipient. The law&#8217;s intention is that any such backdoors are secret by design. (Leaking details of a TCN to the press is one mechanism for circumventing an information block, but it&#8217;s important to note that Apple has yet to make any public comment on these reports.)<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to the rights group the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eff.org\/deeplinks\/2016\/03\/thinking-about-term-backdoor\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Electronic Frontier Foundation<\/a>, the term &#8220;backdoor&#8221; dates back to the 1980s, when backdoor (and &#8220;trapdoor&#8221;) were used to refer to secret accounts and\/or passwords created to allow someone unknown access into a system. But over the years, the word has been used to label a wide range of attempts to degrade, circumvent, or otherwise compromise the data security enabled by encryption.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While backdoors are in the news again, thanks to the U.K. going after Apple&#8217;s encrypted iCloud backups, it&#8217;s important to be aware that data access demands date back decades.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Back in the 1990s, for example, the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) developed encrypted hardware for processing voice and data messages that had a backdoor baked into it \u2014 with the goal of allowing the security services to intercept encrypted communications. The &#8220;Clipper Chip,&#8221; as it was known, used a system of key escrow \u2014 meaning an encryption key was created and stored by government agencies in order to facilitate access to the encrypted data in the event that state authorities wanted in.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The NSA&#8217;s attempt to flog chips with baked-in backdoors failed over a lack of adoption following a security and privacy backlash. Though the Clipper Chip is credited with helping to fire up cryptologists&#8217; efforts to develop and spread strong encryption software in a bid to secure data against prying government overreach.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Clipper Chip is also a good example of where an attempt to mandate system access was done publicly. It&#8217;s worth noting that backdoors don&#8217;t always have to be secret. (In the U.K.&#8217;s iCloud case, state agents clearly wanted to gain access without Apple users knowing about it.)<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Add to that, governments frequently deploy emotive propaganda around demands to access data in a bid to drum up public support and\/or put pressure on service providers to comply \u2014 such as by arguing that access to E2EE is necessary to combat child abuse, or terrorism, or prevent some other heinous crime.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Backdoors can have a way of coming back to bite their creators, though. For example, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2024\/11\/14\/us-confirms-china-backed-hackers-breached-telecom-providers-to-steal-wiretap-data\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">China-backed hackers<\/a> were behind the compromise of federally mandated wiretap systems <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2024\/10\/07\/the-30-year-old-internet-backdoor-law-that-came-back-to-bite\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">last fall<\/a> \u2014 apparently gaining access to data of users of U.S. telcos and ISPs thanks to a 30-year-old federal law that had mandated the backdoor access (albeit, in that case, of non-E2EE data), underscoring the risks of intentionally baking blanket access points into systems.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Governments also have to worry about foreign backdoors creating risks for their own citizens and national security.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There have been multiple instances of Chinese hardware and software being suspected of harboring backdoors over the years. Concerns over potential backdoor risks led some countries, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/11\/30\/uk-shrinks-timetable-for-telcos-to-stop-installing-5g-kit-from-huawei\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">including the U.K.<\/a>, to take steps to remove or limit the use of Chinese tech products, such as components used in critical telecoms infrastructure, in recent years. Fears of backdoors, too, can also be a powerful motivator.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Talk of backdoors in encrypted services is once again doing the rounds after reports emerged that the U.K. government is seeking to force Apple to open up iCloud&#8217;s end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) device backup offering.

Flickr&#8217;s paid plans start at $10.44 per month for unlimited storage.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If you want to look at features beyond personal usage, Flickr allows you to make your photos public so others can find them. You can also join groups based on different topics.<\/p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-dropbox\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.dropbox.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Dropbox<\/a><\/h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Free storage:<\/strong> 5GB<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dropbox is not a storage service centered around photos, but that could be an advantage if you are looking to store things beyond photos in the cloud. The company has paid plans starting at $9.99 per month for 2TB of storage, which is similar to <a href=\"https:\/\/one.google.com\/about\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Google One&#8217;s premium plan<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div class=\"marfeel-experience-inline-cta wp-block-tc23-marfeel-experience\">\n<\/div>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-ente\"><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/ente.io\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Ente<\/a><\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Free storage:<\/strong> 5GB<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ente was created by a former Google engineer as a more private alternative to Google Photos. The service has end-to-end encryption protection for photos, which means the company doesn&#8217;t collect any data. The app is available across platforms and includes features to identify and annotate people; show photos from different locations; and create categories like sunsets, memes, and documents. All of this is processed on your device. <\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ente&#8217;s monthly plans start from $2.49 per month for 50GB of storage, which can be shared with five other people. Ente&#8217;s core code is open sourced, so you can modify it to have a self-hosted version as well.<\/p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"2276\" height=\"3483\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/Ente.jpeg?w=444\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2962099\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/Ente.jpeg 2276w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/Ente.jpeg?resize=98,150 98w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/Ente.jpeg?resize=196,300 196w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/Ente.jpeg?resize=768,1175 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/Ente.jpeg?resize=444,680 444w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/Ente.jpeg?resize=784,1200 784w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/Ente.jpeg?resize=836,1280 836w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/Ente.jpeg?resize=281,430 281w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/Ente.jpeg?resize=470,720 470w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/Ente.jpeg?resize=588,900 588w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/Ente.jpeg?resize=523,800 523w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/Ente.jpeg?resize=1004,1536 1004w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/Ente.jpeg?resize=1338,2048 1338w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/Ente.jpeg?resize=437,668 437w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/Ente.jpeg?resize=245,375 245w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/Ente.jpeg?resize=403,617 403w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/Ente.jpeg?resize=347,531 347w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 2276px) 100vw, 2276px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong>Ente<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-cryptee\"><a href=\"https:\/\/crypt.ee\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Cryptee<\/a><\/h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Free storage:<\/strong> 100MB<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cryptee is another photo-storing service that focuses on privacy; it&#8217;s also open source.

The service works on iOS, Android, Windows, Mac, and Linux through a progressive web app and uses AES256 encryption to protect your media.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Apart from being a photo storage service, it has a built-in document editor that supports markdown, code, and KaTeX math.

Consumers use the apps to find and order food like pizza, egg rolls, or pad thai from restaurants. A gig economy worker then picks up and delivers the food to the consumer.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the two companies also compete with their own white-label delivery services \u2013 called Uber Direct and DoorDash Drive on-Demand \u2013 which both launched in 2020. These services are cheaper for restaurants, allowing patrons to order directly from the restaurants&#8217; own apps and websites, while Uber and DoorDash manage the couriers behind the scenes.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Uber claims in its suit that DoorDash handles first-party deliveries for more than 90% of the largest enterprise restaurants in America, and it alleges DoorDash used anticompetitive practices to win the market.<\/p>\n<div class=\"marfeel-experience-inline-cta wp-block-tc23-marfeel-experience\">\n<\/div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">&#8220;More than 1 million merchants partner with Uber Eats because we\u2019ve helped them to reach more customers and provided them the freedom to decide how they want to grow their businesses with delivery,&#8221; Sarfraz Maredia, head of the Americas for delivery at Uber, said in an emailed statement. &#8220;We\u2019ve increasingly heard complaints from restaurants that DoorDash\u2019s tactics are limiting that freedom and punishing them for seeking better options. We hope this filing puts an end to those unfair practices so that restaurants can choose what\u2019s best for them without fear of penalty or retribution.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In one example from the lawsuit, Uber says that an unnamed &#8220;significant restaurant company&#8221; told the company it would not move forward with a long-planned rollout of Uber Direct across several of its restaurant brands. The reason, Uber claims, is because DoorDash allegedly threatened to increase the rates it charges the restaurant company to use DoorDash&#8217;s third-party delivery services if it continued to use Uber Direct.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Uber says this was not a one-off event, but rather that multiple customer have told the company they feel &#8220;like they\u00a0have a &#8216;gun to their head,&#8217; that DoorDash is a &#8216;monopolist,&#8217; and that they are being bullied by\u00a0DoorDash.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Uber has requested a jury trial; the company did not specify the amount of damages in the complaint. However, Uber claims these anticompetitive practices have cost the company &#8220;millions of dollars in revenue&#8221; and also restricted the growth of Uber Direct.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ride-share giant Uber filed a lawsuit Friday against DoorDash, accusing the delivery outfit of stifling competition by intimidating restaurant owners into exclusive deals.

company &#8220;paused&#8221; discussions with book publishers on licensing deals to supply some of its generative AI models with training data.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The filings are related to the case&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.courtlistener.com\/docket\/67569326\/kadrey-v-meta-platforms-inc\/?order_by=desc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Kadrey v. Meta Platforms<\/a> \u2014 one of many such cases winding through the U.S. court system that&#8217;s pitted AI companies against authors and other intellectual property holders. For the most part, the defendants in these cases \u2014 AI companies \u2014 have claimed that training on copyrighted content is &#8220;fair use.&#8221; The plaintiffs \u2014 copyright holders \u2014 have vociferously disagreed.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new filings submitted to the court Friday, which include partial transcripts of Meta employee depositions taken by attorneys for plaintiffs in the case, suggest that certain Meta staff felt negotiating AI training data licenses for books might not be scalable. <\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to one transcript, Sy Choudhury, who leads Meta&#8217;s AI partnership initiatives, said that Meta&#8217;s outreach to various publishers was met with &#8220;very slow uptake in engagement and interest.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">&#8220;I don&#8217;t recall the entire list, but I remember we had made a long list from initially scouring the Internet of top publishers, et cetera,&#8221; Choudhury said, per the transcript, &#8220;and we didn&#8217;t get contact and feedback from \u2014 from a lot of our cold call outreaches to try to establish contact.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Choudhury added, &#8220;There were a few, like, that did, you know, engage, but not many.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to the court transcripts, Meta paused certain AI-related book licensing efforts in early April 2023 after encountering &#8220;timing&#8221; and other logistical setbacks. Choudhury said some publishers, in particular fiction book publishers, turned out to not in fact have the rights to the content that Meta was considering licensing, per a transcript.<\/p>\n<div class=\"marfeel-experience-inline-cta wp-block-tc23-marfeel-experience\">\n<\/div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">&#8220;I&#8217;d like to point out that the \u2014 in the fiction category, we quickly learned from the business development team that most of the publishers we were talking to, they themselves were representing that they did not have, actually, the rights to license the data to us,&#8221; Choudhury said. &#8220;And so it would take a long time to engage with all their authors.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Choudhury noted during his deposition that Meta has on at least one other occasion paused licensing efforts related to AI development, according to a transcript.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">&#8220;I am aware of licensing efforts such, for example, we tried to license 3D worlds from different game engine and game manufacturers for our AI research team,&#8221; Choudhury said. &#8220;And in the same way that I&#8217;m describing here for fiction and textbook data, we got very little engagement to even have a conversation [&#8230;] We decided to \u2014 in that case, we decided to build our own solution.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Counsel for the plaintiffs, who include bestselling authors Sarah Silverman and Ta-Nehisi Coates, have amended their complaint several times since the case was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, San Francisco Division in 2023. The latest amended complaint submitted by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel alleges that Meta, among other offenses, cross-referenced certain pirated books with copyrighted books available for license to determine whether it made sense to pursue a licensing agreement with a publisher.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The complaint also accuses Meta of <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2025\/01\/15\/in-ai-copyright-case-zuckerberg-turns-to-youtube-for-his-defense\/\">using &#8220;shadow libraries&#8221; containing pirated e-books<\/a> to train several of the company&#8217;s AI models, including its popular Llama series of &#8220;open&#8221; models. According to the complaint, Meta may have secured some of the libraries via torrenting. Torrenting, a way of distributing files across the web, requires that torrenters simultaneously \u201cseed,\u201d or upload, the files they\u2019re trying to obtain \u2014 <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2025\/01\/09\/mark-zuckerberg-gave-metas-llama-team-the-ok-to-train-on-copyrighted-works-filing-claims\/\">which the plaintiffs asserted is a form of copyright infringement<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>New court filings in an AI copyright case against Meta add credence to earlier reports that the company &#8220;paused&#8221; discussions with book publishers on licensing deals to supply some of its generative AI models with training data.

dull debut did little to loosen the stuck IPO window, expert says"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">SailPoint\u2019s IPO on Thursday was a disappointment for anyone <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2025\/02\/04\/okta-competitor-sailpoint-races-toward-11-5b-ipo\/\">hoping it would indicate that tech IPOs are hot<\/a> again. <\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The first day\u2019s trading ended below the $23 initial price. The stock fared a tad better Friday, closing at over $24. But that\u2019s nothing close to the big bang companies and VCs hope for.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For instance, ServiceTitan, the last tech IPO in December, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2024\/12\/12\/servicetitans-ipo-is-a-big-winner-that-could-inspire-fintechs\/\">was wildly successful<\/a>. Share price popped from $71 to as high as $105 on Day 1, and is still currently trading at around $100.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Back-to-back successes would have served as a signal <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2025\/02\/01\/here-are-all-the-ipos-reported-to-be-in-the-works-for-2025\/\">that the painfully stuck-closed IPO window<\/a> is opening at last.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Instead, retail investors are exercising discernment, not wild enthusiasm.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cI\u2019m hesitant to draw too many conclusions on the appetite for tech or software IPOs from it,\u201d IPO expert Nick Einhorn, VP of research for Renaissance Capital, tells TechCrunch. \u201cWhile the company has good growth, it may not have stood out enough in the cybersecurity landscape to be awarded a premium sales multiple.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Renaissance Capital is an IPO market research firm that also offers an IPO exchange-traded fund (ETF).<\/p>\n<div class=\"marfeel-experience-inline-cta wp-block-tc23-marfeel-experience\">\n<\/div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">SailPoint was a bit of an odd IPO because it wasn\u2019t a startup. It was previously a public company until PE firm Thoma Bravo took it private in 2022, valuing it at $6.9 billion at the time. The private equity giant is still the majority owner.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This was a leveraged-buyout company as an IPO, not a classic venture-backed startup. VC-backed startups going public often have the kind of growth potential that excites investors, as was the case with ServiceTitan.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On the positive side for SailPoint, the company priced its initial 60 million shares at $23, above its previously announced range of $19 and $21. SailPoint raked in over $1.3 billion, which it will use for operations and to pay off about $1.5 billion of debt it showed on its books, according to a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/2030781\/000119312525019604\/d885522ds1a.htm#rom885522_7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">regulatory filing<\/a>. It&#8217;s also at about a $13 billion market cap, a boost from what Thoma Bravo paid.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">&#8220;In no way did we consider this a disappointing IPO. We went from mid-point of $20&nbsp;to a close of $25 on Day 2. In our minds, it&#8217;s a very successful IPO,&#8221; CEO Mark McClain told TechCrunch.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, the upshot for those looking for a sign that IPOs could be flowing again soon (especially employees of late-stage startups looking at their paper-money stock and stock options): the signals remain murky.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>SailPoint\u2019s IPO on Thursday was a disappointment for anyone hoping it would indicate that tech IPOs are hot again.

OpenAI&#8217;s press account on X, Bret Taylor, board chair, called Musk&#8217;s bid &#8220;an attempt to disrupt his competition.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">&#8220;OpenAI is not for sale, and the board has unanimously rejected Mr. Musk&#8217;s latest attempt to disrupt his competition,&#8221; Taylor said. &#8220;Any potential reorganization of OpenAI will strengthen our nonprofit and its mission to ensure [artificial general intelligence] benefits all of humanity.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The New York Times <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2025\/02\/14\/technology\/openai-elon-musk.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reported<\/a> that OpenAI also sent a letter to Musk\u2019s lawyer, Marc Toberoff, saying that the bid was &#8220;not in the best interests of [OpenAI&#8217;s] mission.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Monday, Musk, his AI company, xAI, and a group of\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2025\/02\/10\/these-are-the-investors-funding-musks-97-billion-openai-takeover-attempt\/\">investors<\/a>\u00a0offered to buy OpenAI&#8217;s nonprofit for $97.4 billion. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the company\u2019s board of directors\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2025\/02\/10\/elon-musk-led-team-submits-97-4b-bid-for-openai\/\">quickly \u2014 but not formally \u2014 dismissed the unsolicited proposal<\/a>. In a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/mikeisaac\/status\/1889498810008912039?s=46\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">statement<\/a>, Andy Nussbaum, the counsel representing OpenAI\u2019s board, said Musk\u2019s bid &#8220;doesn\u2019t set a value for [OpenAI\u2019s] nonprofit&#8221; and that the nonprofit is &#8220;not for sale.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk, an OpenAI co-founder, last year brought a lawsuit against the company and Altman that alleges that OpenAI engaged in anticompetitive behavior and fraud, among other offenses.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit before it transitioned to a &#8220;capped-profit&#8221; structure in 2019. The nonprofit is the sole controlling shareholder of the capped-profit OpenAI corporation, which retains formal fiduciary responsibility to the nonprofit\u2019s charter.&nbsp;OpenAI is now in the process of restructuring \u2014 this time to a traditional for-profit company, specifically a public benefit corporation. But Musk, via the lawsuit, is seeking to enjoin the conversion.<\/p>\n<div class=\"marfeel-experience-inline-cta wp-block-tc23-marfeel-experience\">\n<\/div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a court filing on Wednesday, lawyers for Musk said the billionaire <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2025\/02\/12\/elon-musk-will-withdraw-bid-for-openais-nonprofit-if-its-board-agrees-to-terms\/\">will withdraw his bid<\/a> if OpenAI&#8217;s board &#8220;preserve[s] the charity\u2019s mission&#8221; and halts OpenAI&#8217;s conversion to a for-profit.

year.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Growth in the U.S. will be lower than China though still significant, adding as much demand through 2027 as California has today.<\/p>\n\n<p

TechCrunch will update if Musk or the automaker responds.<\/p>\n<div class=\"marfeel-experience-inline-cta wp-block-tc23-marfeel-experience\">\n<\/div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The motivation for Donovan &#8212; who is also an assistant professor of journalism at Boston University, but said she is acting in her capacity as a U.S. citizen &#8212; came when she saw the first few small protests outside Tesla stores last week.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cI was inspired by a little protest in Maine, where people had brought some signs to a Tesla charging station, and how that had brought about some conversation and allowed people to meet each other and to discuss what&#8217;s happening,\u201d Donovan said.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So, earlier this week, Donovan started posting.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cIf Musk thinks he can speed run through DC downloading personal data, we can certainly bang some pots and pans on the sidewalks infront [sic] of Tesla dealerships,\u201d she <a href=\"https:\/\/bsky.app\/profile\/bostonjoan.bsky.social\/post\/3lhpocpthvc2i\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">wrote<\/a> on February 8, while linking to Tesla\u2019s own list of its stores in the U.S. She added a hashtag, \u201c#TeslaTakeover.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Winter, who worked with Donovan to organize showings of his 2022 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.yteffect.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">documentary<\/a> The YouTube Effect at universities, told TechCrunch that he saw the posts and reached out to her to help organize the effort.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cSell your Teslas, dump your stock, join the picket lines,\u201d Winter <a href=\"https:\/\/bsky.app\/profile\/alexwinter.com\/post\/3lhtgcxom5c23\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">posted<\/a> to Bluesky on February 10. \u201cHurting Tesla is stopping Musk, and stopping Musk will help save lives and our democracy.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After that post, Winter and Donovan encouraged people to set up their own local Tesla Takeover events.&nbsp;As of Friday afternoon, people had set up 42 protest events throughout the U.S., including California, Florida, Texas, and New York.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Winter told TechCrunch in an interview that he partnered with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.disruption-project.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">The Disruption Project<\/a>, a group that offers training for people interested in mass activism. He said hundreds of people have RSVP\u2019d to the various events so far, and that more are popping up each day. Winter also said he\u2019s even heard from people who are planning them internationally.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The protests are about more than shaping optics and building community, Winter said. Musk\u2019s vast wealth is in large part tied to his ownership of about 20% of Tesla\u2019s stock. That makes him somewhat vulnerable to large swings in the company\u2019s stock price &#8212; doubly so because he has borrowed an incredible amount of money against those shares.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the exact dollar amount is unknown, as of an April 2024 regulatory filing, Musk had used nearly 60% of all the Tesla shares he owned at the time <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1318605\/000110465924053333\/tm2326076d15_def14a.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">as collateral for loans<\/a>. Theoretically, if Tesla\u2019s stock price were to sink low enough, Musk\u2019s lenders could demand he pay back what\u2019s still owed, or at least make him renegotiate their terms.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cThe long goal is to devalue, to create a vote of no confidence in the company&#8217;s future, and to prompt a widespread selling of shares, which would legitimately hurt him,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I also see enormous value in just the public-facing activist education and literacy aspect of this.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Winter\u2019s background makes him well-prepared for that education effort. He\u2019s made documentaries about the Panama Papers (a project that exposed financial crime and corruption around the globe), and the potential harms of YouTube\u2019s algorithmic feed. He is also involved in the \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2025\/01\/13\/free-our-feeds-campaign-aims-to-billionaire-proof-blueskys-tech\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Free our Feeds<\/a>\u201d initiative, which is an effort to build an open social media system on Bluesky\u2019s AT Protocol.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With that in mind, it\u2019s no surprise he said he\u2019s been concerned about Musk\u2019s influence over tech for years.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Donovan said she believes Musk is \u201creally leveraging the fact that many Americans are ignorant of how the government actually works\u201d while spreading this misinformation. She worries that it will lead to violence &#8212; especially as Musk and his supporters single out government workers, judges, and their family members.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That\u2019s another reason why Donovan said she wants people to get out and protest.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cMy hope is that people come together, acting locally but thinking globally at these protests, and find other more local ways to resist,\u201d Donovan said. \u201cI think one of the things that Musk has overlooked is that power isn&#8217;t derived from the federal government, power is derived from the states, and there&#8217;s a lot that different state agencies can do to rein in the power of the federal government to force accountability.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As Elon Musk and his acolytes rip through the federal government looking for agencies to throw into the \u201cwood chipper,\u201d a grassroots effort to hit the world\u2019s richest man where it hurts is picking up steam.

Facebook particularly calls out the opportunities in India, and the role that the network will play in how it rolls out AI services globally, as two key reasons for building the network.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In terms of the network itself, Meta says it will be breaking new ground with its architecture, using 24 fiber pair cables, and what it describes as first-of-its-kind routing, \u201cmaximizing the cable laid in deep water \u2014 at depths up to 7,000 meters\u201d along with new burial techniques to reduce faults in areas deemed &#8220;high risk,&#8221; either because of geographical issues, or politics \u2014 and sometimes both.<\/p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignwide size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/Meta-Project-Waterworth-map.png.webp\" alt=\"an image showing the subsea cable spanning the globe, going between the U.S., South Africa, India and much of the Asia region\" class=\"wp-image-2966558\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/Meta-Project-Waterworth-map.png.webp 1920w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/Meta-Project-Waterworth-map.png.webp?resize=150,84 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/Meta-Project-Waterworth-map.png.webp?resize=300,169 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/Meta-Project-Waterworth-map.png.webp?resize=768,432 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/Meta-Project-Waterworth-map.png.webp?resize=680,383 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/Meta-Project-Waterworth-map.png.webp?resize=1200,675 1200w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/Meta-Project-Waterworth-map.png.webp?resize=1280,720 1280w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/Meta-Project-Waterworth-map.png.webp?resize=430,242 430w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/Meta-Project-Waterworth-map.png.webp?resize=720,405 720w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/Meta-Project-Waterworth-map.png.webp?resize=900,506 900w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/Meta-Project-Waterworth-map.png.webp?resize=800,450 800w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/Meta-Project-Waterworth-map.png.webp?resize=1536,864 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/Meta-Project-Waterworth-map.png.webp?resize=668,375 668w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/Meta-Project-Waterworth-map.png.webp?resize=1097,617 1097w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/Meta-Project-Waterworth-map.png.webp?resize=708,398 708w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">The subsea cable spanning the U.S., South Africa, India and Asia.<\/span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong>Meta<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Previously, we noted that geopolitics is one of the major factors in the market influencing Meta to build its own subsea infrastructure.

feature"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mastodon, the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/07\/24\/what-is-mastodon\/\">decentralized alternative to X<\/a>, is going to adopt a controversial feature from the platform formerly known as Twitter: quote posts. The company on Friday shared the progress it&#8217;s making on the implementation of the feature, which has divided users over its potential to be used for online abuse and bullying.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Critics have long argued that the addition of quote tweets <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theringer.com\/2018\/05\/02\/tech\/twitter-retweet-quote-endorsement-function-trolls\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">helped ruin Twitter,<\/a> turning the network <a href=\"https:\/\/slate.com\/technology\/2017\/12\/dunking-is-delicious-and-also-probably-making-twitter-terrible.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">into a more toxic online community<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some Mastodon users feel strongly that quote posts don&#8217;t belong on Mastodon, as the feature is often used to &#8220;dunk&#8221; on another person&#8217;s post, which not only breeds negativity but can also result in helping spur a flood of abusive replies to the original post&#8217;s author \u2014 especially if the dunker is a high-profile individual with a lot of followers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, other Mastodon users want to see quote posts added, as the feature makes it easier to reference another person&#8217;s post and its content when making a response. Plus, quote posts would bring the network more in line with its competitors, including X as well as newer rivals like Threads and Bluesky. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1594\" height=\"975\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/mastodon-posts.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2966529\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/mastodon-posts.png 1594w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/mastodon-posts.png?resize=150,92 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/mastodon-posts.png?resize=300,184 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/mastodon-posts.png?resize=768,470 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/mastodon-posts.png?resize=680,416 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/mastodon-posts.png?resize=1200,734 1200w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/mastodon-posts.png?resize=1280,783 1280w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/mastodon-posts.png?resize=430,263 430w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/mastodon-posts.png?resize=720,440 720w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/mastodon-posts.png?resize=900,551 900w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/mastodon-posts.png?resize=800,489 800w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/mastodon-posts.png?resize=1536,940 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/mastodon-posts.png?resize=668,409 668w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/mastodon-posts.png?resize=613,375 613w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/mastodon-posts.png?resize=1009,617 1009w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/mastodon-posts.png?resize=708,433 708w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1594px) 100vw, 1594px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong>Mastodon<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mastodon noted in <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.joinmastodon.org\/2025\/02\/bringing-quote-posts-to-mastodon\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">its blog post<\/a> that it&#8217;s aware that the feature is both a &#8220;source of concern&#8221; for some and &#8220;highly requested&#8221; by others.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">&#8220;Many people simply do not want their content to be reframed by others; or they may find that if it is reposted, they receive unwelcome attention,&#8221; the Mastodon blog post says.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The organization applied for a <a href=\"https:\/\/nlnet.nl\/project\/Mastodon-Quoting\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">grant<\/a> to help fund the development of quote posts back in 2024 after earlier <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.joinmastodon.org\/2023\/05\/a-new-onboarding-experience-on-mastodon\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">discussions<\/a> around the feature. Now, the team is sharing its progress, particularly in terms of how it hopes to mitigate user complaints.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For starters, Mastodon says it will allow users to control whether their posts can be quoted at all. This would protect people from being the recipient of unwanted attention or hateful replies to some extent. (Though, arguably, people could still screenshot someone&#8217;s post to circulate it more broadly if they intended to troll the user.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, users will be notified if someone quotes them, and they&#8217;ll be able to withdraw their post from the quoted context at any time. This latter option could help in the case that someone&#8217;s quote post goes viral, and the original poster starts to receive too much attention or even abuse, forcing them to reconsider whether they want their post to be quotable at all.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Beyond the potential for abuse, Mastodon says there are also technical challenges around the implementation of quote posts, as there&#8217;s not a standardized way to build the feature in ActivityPub, the underlying protocol that powers Mastodon and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2024\/06\/25\/welcome-to-the-fediverse-your-guide-to-mastodon-threads-bluesky-and-more\/\">other federated apps<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some third-party Mastodon clients also already offer their own version of quote posts, but they don&#8217;t include the features that Mastodon wants to add for additional user control and privacy. As a result, Mastodon is <a href=\"https:\/\/codeberg.org\/fediverse\/fep\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">collaborating with others<\/a> to create a specification that would allow all Mastodon apps and clients to access the same functionality.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Quote posts will also affect other parts of Mastodon&#8217;s code base, the announcement states, including the ActivityPub-handling code, the public API, the web user interface, the moderation panel and capabilities, the administration panel, and the official iOS and Android applications.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unfortunately, Mastodon&#8217;s announcement didn&#8217;t share how much longer it will be before the feature is added or any sort of timeline for public release, only saying that quote posts &#8220;will still take more time to develop.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Mastodon, the decentralized alternative to X, is going to adopt a controversial feature from the platform formerly known as Twitter: quote posts.

Wenfeng, who reportedly began dabbling in trading while a student at Zhejiang University, launched High-Flyer Capital Management as a hedge fund in 2019 focused on developing and deploying AI algorithms.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2023, High-Flyer started DeepSeek as a lab dedicated to researching AI tools separate from its financial business. With High-Flyer as one of its investors, the lab spun off into its own company, also called DeepSeek.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">From day one, DeepSeek built its own data center clusters for model training. But like other AI companies in China, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2025\/01\/15\/biden-administration-adds-14-additional-chinese-firms-to-trade-blacklist\/\">DeepSeek has been affected by U.S. export bans on hardware<\/a>. To train one of its more recent models, the company was forced to use Nvidia H800 chips, a less-powerful version of a chip, the H100, available to U.S. companies.<\/p>\n<div class=\"marfeel-experience-inline-cta wp-block-tc23-marfeel-experience\">\n<\/div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">DeepSeek&#8217;s technical team is said to skew young. The company <a href=\"https:\/\/www.scmp.com\/tech\/tech-trends\/article\/3293050\/meet-deepseek-chinese-start-changing-how-ai-models-are-trained\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reportedly aggressively recruits<\/a> doctorate AI researchers from top Chinese universities. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2025\/01\/23\/technology\/deepseek-china-ai-chips.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">DeepSeek also hires people without any computer science background<\/a> to help its tech better understand a wide range of subjects, per The New York Times.<\/p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-tc23-podcast-player\">\n\t<div class=\"global-consent eu-blocked tcembed-iframe tcembed--megaphone\" data-iframe-src=\"https:\/\/playlist.megaphone.fm?e=YFL1540103161\" data-iframe-width=\"100%\" data-iframe-height=\"200px\" data-iframe-sandbox=\"\"><\/div><\/iframe>\n\t<\/div>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-deepseek-s-strong-models\">DeepSeek&#8217;s strong models<\/h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">DeepSeek unveiled its first set of models \u2014 DeepSeek Coder, DeepSeek LLM, and DeepSeek Chat \u2014 in November 2023. But it wasn&#8217;t until last spring, when the startup released its next-gen DeepSeek-V2 family of models, that the AI industry started to take notice.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">DeepSeek-V2, a general-purpose text- and image-analyzing system, performed well in various AI benchmarks \u2014 and was far cheaper to run than comparable models at the time. It forced DeepSeek&#8217;s domestic competition, including ByteDance and Alibaba, to cut the usage prices for some of their models, and make others completely free.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2024\/12\/26\/deepseeks-new-ai-model-appears-to-be-one-of-the-best-open-challengers-yet\/\">DeepSeek-V3<\/a>, launched in December 2024, only added to DeepSeek&#8217;s notoriety.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to DeepSeek\u2019s internal benchmark testing, DeepSeek V3 outperforms both downloadable, openly available models like Meta\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2024\/12\/06\/meta-unveils-a-new-more-efficient-llama-model\/\">Llama<\/a> and \u201cclosed\u201d models that can only be accessed through an API, like OpenAI&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2024\/05\/13\/openais-newest-model-is-gpt-4o\/\">GPT-4o<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Equally impressive is DeepSeek&#8217;s R1 &#8220;reasoning&#8221; model. Released in January, DeepSeek claims <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2025\/01\/27\/deepseek-claims-its-reasoning-model-beats-openais-o1-on-certain-benchmarks\/\">R1 performs as well as OpenAI\u2019s&nbsp;o1&nbsp;model on key benchmarks<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Being a reasoning model, R1 effectively fact-checks itself, which&nbsp;helps it to avoid some of the&nbsp;pitfalls&nbsp;that normally trip up models. Reasoning models take a little longer \u2014 usually seconds to minutes longer \u2014 to arrive at solutions compared to a typical non-reasoning model. The upside is that they tend to be more reliable in domains such as physics, science, and math.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There is a downside to R1, DeepSeek V3, and DeepSeek&#8217;s other models, however. Being Chinese-developed AI, they&#8217;re subject to&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/10975044-f194-4513-857b-e17491d2a9e9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">benchmarking<\/a>&nbsp;by China\u2019s internet regulator to ensure that its responses &#8220;embody core socialist values.&#8221; In DeepSeek&#8217;s chatbot app, for example, R1 won\u2019t answer questions about Tiananmen Square or Taiwan\u2019s autonomy.<\/p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-disruptive-approach\">A disruptive approach<\/h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If DeepSeek has a business model, it&#8217;s not clear what that model is, exactly. The company prices its products and services well below market value \u2014 and gives others away for free.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The way DeepSeek tells it, efficiency breakthroughs have enabled it to maintain extreme cost competitiveness. Some experts <a href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/firstadopter\/status\/1884009045461520602\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">dispute<\/a> the figures the company has supplied, however.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Whatever the case may be, developers have taken to DeepSeek&#8217;s models, which aren&#8217;t open source as the phrase is commonly understood but are available under permissive licenses that allow for commercial use. According to Clem Delangue, the CEO of Hugging Face, one of the platforms hosting DeepSeek&#8217;s models, <a href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/ClementDelangue\/status\/1883946119723708764\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">developers on Hugging Face have created over 500 \u201cderivative\u201d models of R1<\/a> that have racked up 2.5 million downloads combined.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">DeepSeek&#8217;s success against larger and more established rivals has been <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2025\/01\/27\/technology\/what-is-deepseek-china-ai.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">described as &#8220;upending AI&#8221;<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2025\/01\/30\/how-deepseek-changed-silicon-valleys-ai-landscape\/\">&#8220;over-hyped.&#8221;<\/a> The company&#8217;s success was at least in part responsible for <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2025\/01\/27\/nvidia-drops-600bn-off-its-market-cap-amid-the-rise-of-deepseek\/\">causing Nvidia&#8217;s stock price to drop by 18% on Monday<\/a>, and for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2025-01-28\/sam-altman-praises-deepseek-r1-and-promises-more-from-openai?embedded-checkout=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">eliciting a public response<\/a> from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Microsoft <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2025\/01\/29\/microsoft-brings-a-deepseek-model-to-its-cloud\/\">announced that DeepSeek is available on its Azure AI Foundry service<\/a>, Microsoft&#8217;s platform that brings together AI services for enterprises under a single banner. When asked about DeepSeek&#8217;s impact on Meta&#8217;s AI spending during its first-quarter earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2025\/01\/29\/zuck-shrugs-off-deepseek-vows-to-spend-hundreds-of-billions-on-ai\/\">spending on AI infrastructure will continue to be a \u201cstrategic advantage\u201d<\/a> for Meta. <\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the same time, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2025\/01\/31\/hundreds-of-companies-are-blocking-deepseek-over-china-data-risks\/\">some companies are banning DeepSeek<\/a>, and so are entire <a href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/capitalnewshq\/status\/1887352587478876611\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">countries<\/a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/capitalnewshq\/status\/1887352587478876611\">and<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2025\/01\/30\/pentagon-scrambles-to-block-deepseek-after-employees-connect-to-chinese-servers\/\">governments<\/a>.

But the U.S. government appears to be <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/deepseek-ai-raises-national-security-concerns-trump\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">growing wary of what it perceives as harmful foreign influence<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>TechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter!&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/newsletters\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Sign up here<\/a>&nbsp;to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This story was originally published January 28, 2025, and will be updated continuously with more information.<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>DeepSeek has gone viral.

It had thousands of users, a waitlist, and was generating revenue when they applied to YC, Camara said.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">They planned to embed their product into VS Code \u201cinside the code editor, like Cursor, only teaching you how to code,\u201d Peffer described.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But once they were accepted into YC, their advisers told them that <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2024\/11\/22\/y-combinator-often-backs-startups-that-duplicate-other-yc-companies-data-shows-its-not-just-ai-code-editors\/\">too many edtech coding products<\/a> exist, and advised them to find another area.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After many tries, they started working on a chatbot for developers to ask questions of documentation.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That&#8217;s how they discovered the challenge of \u201cconnecting these AI systems to the information,\u201d and ensuring that info is accurate, Peffer said. \u201cIf you give garbage to an AI system, you&#8217;re gonna get garbage out.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So they built a web crawler\/scraper as a side project and released it as open source. In a matter of hours, it landed on GitHub\u2019s trending page, gaining 1,000 stars. \u201cSince then, we&#8217;ve crossed 25,000 stars in just 10 months,\u201d Peffer said.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Their customers, which pay for a commercial version, use it for everything from resume parsing to finding sales leads. Firecrawl has raised about $1.7 million so far, according to the founders, and they expect that this first AI agent hire won&#8217;t be their last.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cWhat we imagine happening is that every one of our real employees is going to become highly leveraged with AI. And it&#8217;s not a clear distinction. It&#8217;s like, what&#8217;s the difference between a tool or a workflow or a full agent?\u201d Peffer said.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Note: This story was updated to correct the reason why the founders changed their original product idea. <\/em><\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Last week, an ad from the Y Combinator

He added that, eventually, dislikes will count toward ranking comments.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">&#8220;Some of you may have seen that we&#8217;re testing a new button next to comments on Instagram &#8211; this gives people a private way to signal that they don\u2019t feel good about that particular comment. I want to be clear: this is a test, there is no dislike count, nor will anyone know if you tap the button. Eventually, we may integrate this signal into comments ranking to move disliked comments lower down. Our hope is that this might help make comments more friendly on Instagram,&#8221; Mosseri said.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last month, app sleuth Alessandro Paluzzi posted about Instagram <a href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/alex193a\/status\/1880577751566205145\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">testing such a feature<\/a>, and now the company has made it official.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta said that this test is to contribute toward improving the quality of the comment section.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">&#8220;We\u2019re working on ways to help people better control their Instagram experience and what they\u2019re seeing on the app,&#8221; a company spokesperson said. &#8220;We\u2019re testing a new button next to each comment on a Reel or Feed post for people to privately signal they don\u2019t feel good about that particular comment or find it relevant. We&#8217;re testing this with a very small group of people to start. Later, we may also test moving these comments lower down in the comments section to help create a better experience,&#8221; they added.<\/p>\n<div class=\"marfeel-experience-inline-cta wp-block-tc23-marfeel-experience\">\n<\/div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Reddit has had a downvote mechanism for years now, and the platform also uses it to sort different kinds of comments based on upvotes and downvotes.

CEO says it&#8217;s still too early for AI trip planning"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Airbnb says it&#8217;s poised to roll out AI technology &#8212; but not in the way consumers may have initially wanted.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Instead of offering tools to help travelers plan or book their trips with the help of AI agents, Airbnb is planning to first introduce AI to its customer support system. This update will roll out later this summer, the company told investors during its Q4 2024 earnings call on Thursday.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Explained Airbnb co-founder and CEO Brian Chesky, AI can do &#8220;an incredible job&#8221; for customer service as it can speak any language and understand thousands of pages of documents. To start, the AI will work as a customer service agent but its capabilities will expand over time.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While companies like <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2025\/01\/23\/openai-launches-operator-an-ai-agent-that-performs-tasks-autonomously\/\">OpenAI<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2024\/12\/11\/google-unveils-project-mariner-ai-agents-to-use-the-web-for-you\/\">Google<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2024\/11\/18\/perplexity-introduces-a-shopping-feature-for-pro-users\/\">others<\/a> are working on AI agents \u2014 or AI software that can perform a series of tasks on your behalf \u2014 Chesky believes the technology is still too early to be of use to Airbnb just yet. However, he believes that eventually, AI will have a &#8220;profound impact on travel,&#8221; even if nothing has changed for the major travel platforms as of now.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">&#8220;Here&#8217;s what I think about AI. I think it&#8217;s still really early,&#8221; Chesky said. &#8220;It&#8217;s probably similar to&#8230; the mid-to-late &#8217;90s for the internet.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He noted that other companies were working on integrations around trip planning, but that he thinks it&#8217;s too soon for AI trip planning.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s quite [a] bit ready for prime time,&#8221; the CEO added.<\/p>\n<div class=\"marfeel-experience-inline-cta wp-block-tc23-marfeel-experience\">\n<\/div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As AI technology continues to develop, Airbnb will expand the AI-powered customer service agent to be a part of Airbnb&#8217;s search and, at some point much further down the road, it will also become a &#8220;travel and living concierge,&#8221; Chesky said. <\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition to customer service, the company reported some small productivity gains from using AI internally for engineering purposes. But here, too, the executive advised caution, saying, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s flowing to a fundamental step-change in productivity yet.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a few years, those gains could reach some sort of &#8220;medium-term&#8221; impact, Chesky noted, like a 30% increase in technology and engineering productivity.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Airbnb didn&#8217;t say if its use of AI would impact headcount, but CFO Ellie Mertz hinted toward greater efficiencies possible in the realm of customer service, in particular.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">&#8220;In terms of &#8217;25 and the outlook there, I would say, there&#8217;s incremental opportunities across our variable costs, so areas like payment processing and customer service opportunities to just be, frankly, a little bit more efficient and to deliver some margin expansion there,&#8221; Mertz told investors.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Airbnb reported strong earnings in Q4 that saw <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2025\/02\/13\/airbnb-abnb-q4-earnings-2024.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">shares pop by 15%<\/a> after beating on both earnings and revenue.

$56 million in Series C funding co-led by Norwest Venture Partners and Tiger Global, the company has confirmed to TechCrunch exclusively.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The raise represents a first close for the Austin-based ICON, according to a spokesperson. Existing backers CAZ Investments, LEN<sup>X<\/sup>, Modern Ventures, Oakhouse Partners, Overmatch Ventures also participated in the round. Additional funding of \u201cup to $75 million\u201d is planned, according to the spokesperson.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">ICON declined to reveal its new valuation or comment on if the valuation was an up, down or flat. The new capital infusion brings the startup\u2019s total raised to over $500 million. At the time of its last raise in February of 2022 \u2014 a $185 million extension of a Series B round \u2014 ICON\u2019s valuation was said to be \u201capproaching $2 billion.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Former Presidential candidate and Congressman Will Hurd, who has previously invested in ICON, has also joined the company&#8217;s board of directors. <\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founded in late 2017, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https:\/\/www.iconbuild.com\/\">ICON<\/a> launched during SXSW in March 2018 with the first permitted 3D-printed home in the U.S. That 350-square-foot house took about 48 hours (at 25% speed) to print.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">ICON plans to use its new capital mostly to \u201cfuel the development of\u201d <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https:\/\/iconbuild.com\/robotics\">Phoenix<\/a>, its line of multi-story 3D printers so that it can \u201cbegin putting the robotic technology into the hands of builders.\u201d The new robotic printer, the spokesperson said, allows for multi-story construction using a new low carbon building material.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, the company is still building homes itself. ICON still plans to \u201cdesign and build a selection of key projects across residential, hospitality, social\/affordable housing and those within the Department of Defense,\u201d the spokesperson said.<\/p>\n<div class=\"marfeel-experience-inline-cta wp-block-tc23-marfeel-experience\">\n<\/div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Over the years, ICON says it has 3D-printed nearly 200 homes and structures in the U.S. and Mexico \u201cacross social\/affordable, market-rate residential, disaster relief housing, barracks and other structures for the U.S. Army, NASA and DoD.\u201d Some of those structures include single-family homes for the homeless.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In January, the company confirmed that it was <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2025\/01\/09\/icon-a-builder-of-3d-printed-homes-last-valued-around-2-billion-cuts-about-25-of-staff\/\">letting go of 114 employees<\/a>. At the time, the company said it had \u201crecently made a difficult decision to re-align\u201d its team and team size \u201cto focus on our highest priorities and continue to invest in our best growth opportunities.\u201d Presently, it has about 200 employees.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Want to reach out with a tip?

The two previously worked at Deliveroo from the early days, with Rohrbach leading Deliveroo\u2019s 40-person content, research, and design team, while Vagni worked on design systems and internal tooling.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Customers for Plain include companies like Sanity, Laravel, Stytch, and Raycast.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a statement, Neeraj Agrawal, a Battery Ventures general partner, said: \u201cB2B support is moving into this new era of collaboration and AI.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, Plain isn\u2019t the only player in the business of aggregating these customer support channels.

origins for a number of years, former U.S. President Joe Biden <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2024\/04\/24\/biden-signs-bill-that-would-ban-tiktok-if-bytedance-fails-to-sell-the-app\/\">last year passed a law<\/a> that called on ByteDance to sell TikTok\u2019s U.S. operations to a company that wasn&#8217;t owned by a Chinese entity by January 19, 2025, or be banned from the country. The law would have imposed severe financial penalties on app store operators if they didn&#8217;t comply, and following appeals by ByteDance, the Supreme Court voted to uphold the law on <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2025\/01\/17\/supreme-court-upholds-tiktok-ban\/\">January 17<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But right after he assumed office, current U.S. President Donald Trump on January 20 <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2025\/01\/20\/trump-signs-exec-order-delaying-tiktok-enforcement-action-for-75-days\/\">signed an executive order<\/a> aimed at delaying the ban, giving ByteDance a 75-day extension to find a buyer for its U.S. operations.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TikTok promptly <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2025\/01\/20\/trump-signs-exec-order-delaying-tiktok-enforcement-action-for-75-days\/\">restored services in the country<\/a>. Service providers like Oracle restored their services to the app as well, but Apple and Google kept the app out of their U.S. app stores since there was some confusion regarding the penalties that would be imposed, given the law had only been deferred.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Users in the U.S who had uninstalled TikTok were not able to reinstall the app, but those who had not were able to use it.<\/p>\n<div class=\"marfeel-experience-inline-cta wp-block-tc23-marfeel-experience\">\n<\/div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since then, Trump has suggested the U.S. could own a 50% share in TikTok through a joint venture with other tech companies as an alternative to the ban. Alongside signing an executive order to create <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2025\/02\/03\/trump-says-new-us-sovereign-wealth-fund-could-purchase-tiktok\/\">a sovereign wealth fund<\/a>, he suggested the fund could be used to purchase TikTok\u2019s U.S. operations. <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2025\/01\/25\/trump-administration-reportedly-negotiating-an-oracle-takeover-of-tiktok\/\">Oracle <\/a>and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2025\/01\/28\/trump-says-microsoft-is-in-talks-to-acquire-tiktok\/\">Microsoft<\/a> are said to be in the running to buy the app.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rival social networks have tried to bank on the uncertainty around TikTok. Both<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2025\/01\/20\/x-is-rolling-out-a-dedicated-vertical-video-feed-for-us-users\/\"> X<\/a> and<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2025\/01\/19\/bluesky-launches-a-custom-feed-for-vertical-videos\/\"> Bluesky<\/a> quickly launched dedicated vertical video feeds, and Meta announced <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2025\/01\/19\/meta-announces-a-new-video-editing-app-called-edits-amidst-tiktok-and-capcut-ban\/\">a video editing app<\/a> that would compete with CapCut.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to data from analytics firm Sensor Tower, TikTok was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/technology\/apple-restore-tiktok-us-app-store-after-attorney-generals-letter-bloomberg-news-2025-02-14\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the second most downloaded app in the U.S. last year, with 52 million downloads<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Apple and Google on Thursday evening restored TikTok to their respective app stores in the U.S., nearly a month after they removed the short video app following a national security law that banned it in the country.

Its growth <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2024\/03\/08\/turo-car-rental-ipo-profitable-growth\/\">decelerated<\/a>, too.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Turo&#8217;s decision to end its IPO plans comes just one day after peer-to-peer car-sharing company Getaround <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2025\/02\/12\/getaround-abruptly-shuts-down-us-car-sharing-operations\/\">shut down its U.S. operations<\/a>. Like Turo, Getaround began life as a venture-backed company. Unlike Turo, Getaround made the leap back onto the public market in 2022 via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Turo is still operating in the United States \u2014 and elsewhere. As of September 2024, the company reported it had 150,000 active hosts globally, with 350,000 active vehicle listings and 3.5 million active guests. The company also operates in Canada, Australia, and France.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Turo CEO Andre Haddad said in an emailed statement the board &#8220;decided now is not the right time for Turo to pursue a public offering.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Haddad noted Turo&#8217;s strong performance with revenue growing $150 million in 2020 to $958 million in 2024 and hinted at the company&#8217;s investment plans for the future.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">&#8220;We plan to take advantage of our company&#8217;s plans to remain private in order to make important investments in the business that will build long term value for all stakeholders,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Our relentless focus on creating an amazing experience for our hosts and guests has enabled us to outperform all competitors in this space and we have become the leader in all the markets we operate in (US, Canada, France, Australia, and the UK).&#8221;<\/p>\n<div class=\"marfeel-experience-inline-cta wp-block-tc23-marfeel-experience\">\n<\/div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the company&#8217;s revenue has steadily climbed, its growth rate has slowed. <\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company reported revenue of $469 million in 2021, representing 213% year-over-year growth due to a combination of factors, including a boost from the COVID-19 pandemic, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1514587\/000162828024008965\/turoinc-sx1a9.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">according to regulatory filings<\/a>. Revenue popped again in 2022 to $746.6 million, but at a lower 59% year-over-year growth compared to the prior year. Revenue increased in 2023 to $879.7 million, representing 18% year-over-year growth.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has been profitable since 2022 on net income at $154.7 million, although that result dipped to $14.7 million in 2023. The company has not reported full-year results for 2024. <\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In other words, business cratered in 2023, then recovered in 2024, but not quite to the levels needed for that IPO dream.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Turo on Thursday withdrew its plans for an IPO, ending a three-year wait to bring the online car-sharing network to the public marketplace, according to a regulatory filing.

drops &#8216;safety&#8217; from its AI body, now called AI Security Institute, inks MOU with Anthropic"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The U.K. government wants to make a hard pivot into boosting its economy and industry with AI, and as part of that, it\u2019s pivoting an institution that it founded a little over a year ago for a very different purpose. Today the Department of Science, Industry and Technology announced that it would be renaming the AI Safety Institute to the \u201cAI Security Institute.\u201d (Same first letters: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.aisi.gov.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">same URL<\/a>.) With that, the body will shift from primarily exploring areas like existential risk and bias in large language models, to a focus on cybersecurity, specifically \u201cstrengthening protections against the risks&nbsp;AI&nbsp;poses to national&nbsp;security&nbsp;and crime.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alongside this, the government also announced a new partnership with Anthropic. No firm services were announced but the MOU indicates the two will \u201cexplore\u201d using Anthropic\u2019s AI assistant Claude in public services; and Anthropic will aim to contribute to work in scientific research and economic modeling. And at the AI Security Institute, it will provide tools to evaluate AI capabilities in the context of identifying security risks.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">&#8220;AI has the potential to transform how governments serve their citizens,&#8221; Anthropic co-founder and CEO Dario Amodei said in a statement. &#8220;We look forward to exploring how Anthropic&#8217;s AI assistant Claude could help UK government agencies enhance public services, with the goal of discovering new ways to make vital information and services more efficient and accessible to UK residents.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic is the only company being announced today \u2014 coinciding with a week of AI activities in Munich and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2025\/02\/12\/anthropic-ceo-dario-amodei-says-were-in-a-race-to-understand-ai-as-it-becomes-more-powerful\/\">Paris<\/a> \u2014 but it\u2019s not the only one that is working with the government. A series of new tools that were unveiled in January were all powered by OpenAI. (At the time, Peter Kyle, the secretary of state for Technology, said that the government planned to work with various foundational AI companies, and that is what the Anthropic deal is proving out.)\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The government\u2019s switch-up of the AI Safety Institute \u2014 launched <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/11\/01\/politicians-commit-to-collaborate-to-tackle-ai-safety-us-launches-safety-institute\/\">just over a year ago<\/a> with a lot of fanfare \u2014 to AI Security shouldn\u2019t come as too much of a surprise.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When the newly installed Labour government announced its <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2025\/01\/13\/uk-throws-its-hat-into-the-ai-fire\/\">AI-heavy Plan for Change in January<\/a>,&nbsp; it was notable that the words &nbsp;\u201csafety,\u201d \u201charm,\u201d \u201cexistential,\u201d and \u201cthreat\u201d did not appear at all in the document.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That was not an oversight. The government\u2019s plan is to kickstart investment in a more modernized economy, using technology and specifically AI to do that. It wants to work more closely with Big Tech, and it also wants to build its own homegrown big techs. <\/p>\n<div class=\"marfeel-experience-inline-cta wp-block-tc23-marfeel-experience\">\n<\/div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In aid of that, the main messages it\u2019s been promoting have been development, AI, and more development. Civil servants will have their own AI assistant called \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2025\/01\/20\/uk-to-unveil-humphrey-assistant-for-civil-servants-with-other-ai-plans-to-cut-bureaucracy\/\">Humphrey<\/a>,\u201d and they\u2019re being encouraged to share data and use AI in other areas to speed up how they work. Consumers will be <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2025\/01\/21\/uk-plans-digital-wallet-for-drivers-licenses-and-other-id-plus-a-chatbot-powered-by-openai\/\">getting digital wallets<\/a> for their government documents, and chatbots.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So have AI safety issues been resolved? Not exactly, but the message seems to be that they can\u2019t be considered at the expense of progress.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The government claimed that despite the name change, the song will remain the same. <\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cThe changes I\u2019m announcing today represent the logical next step in how we approach responsible AI development \u2013 helping us to unleash AI and grow the economy as part of our Plan for Change,&#8221; Kyle said in a statement. &#8220;The work of the AI Security Institute won\u2019t change, but this renewed focus&nbsp;will ensure our citizens \u2013 and those of our allies \u2013 are protected from those who would look to use AI against our institutions, democratic values, and way of life.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cThe Institute\u2019s focus from the start has been on security and we\u2019ve built a team of scientists focused on evaluating serious risks to the public,&#8221; added Ian Hogarth, who remains the chair of the institute. \u201cOur new criminal misuse team and deepening partnership with the national security community mark the next stage of tackling those risks.\u201c<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Further afield, priorities definitely appear to have changed around the importance of \u201cAI Safety\u201d. The biggest risk the AI Safety Institute in the U.S. is contemplating right now, is that it\u2019s going to be <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2024\/10\/22\/the-u-s-ai-safety-institute-stands-on-shaky-ground\/\">dismantled<\/a>.

contents of previous conversations, the company announced in a <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.google\/feed\/gemini-referencing-past-chats\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blog post<\/a> on Thursday. Gemini can summarize a previous conversation you&#8217;ve had with it, or recall info you shared in another conversation thread.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This means you won&#8217;t have to repeat information you&#8217;ve already shared with Gemini or comb through old threads for additional info.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gemini&#8217;s ability to recall conversations is rolling out today to English-speaking subscribers of Google&#8217;s $20-a-month AI chatbot subscription, Google One AI Premium. In the coming weeks, Google says the recall feature will roll out additional languages and for users with enterprise accounts.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The feature&#8217;s aim is to make Gemini more fluid and personal &#8212; but not every user will be thrilled with the notion of the platform storing old information.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To address privacy concerns, Google says it&#8217;s allowing users to review, delete, or decide how long it will keep your chat history. Users can turn off the recall feature altogether by going to the &#8220;My Activity&#8221; page in Gemini. Google also notes that it never trains AI models based on user conversation histories.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That said, several AI chatbot providers have been experimenting with memory and recall.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has <a href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/sama\/status\/1873816979590787110\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">previously noted<\/a> that improved memory is among ChatGPT&#8217;s most requested features.<\/p>\n<div class=\"marfeel-experience-inline-cta wp-block-tc23-marfeel-experience\">\n<\/div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2024\/11\/19\/googles-gemini-chatbot-now-has-memory\/\">Google<\/a> and<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2024\/02\/13\/chatgpt-will-now-remember-and-forget-things-you-tell-it-to\/\"> OpenAI<\/a> have both enabled more general &#8220;memory&#8221; features for their AI chatbots in the past year. These allow ChatGPT and Gemini to remember details about you, such as how you like to be addressed, your food preferences, or that you prefer riding a bike to driving a car.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, these existing memory features don&#8217;t remember and recall your full chat history by default.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>TechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter!\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/newsletters\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Sign up here<\/a>\u00a0to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Google&#8217;s Gemini AI chatbot can now tailor answers based on the contents of previous conversations, the company announced in a blog post on Thursday.

Many of President Donald Trump\u2019s close allies, including Elon Musk and crypto and AI &#8220;czar&#8221; David Sacks, have accused AI-powered assistants of&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2024\/12\/15\/trumps-silicon-valley-advisers-have-ai-censorship-in-their-crosshairs\/\">censoring conservative viewpoints<\/a>.

Musk\u2019s team responded that&nbsp;it would withdraw the bid if OpenAI ceased its <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2025\/02\/12\/elon-musk-will-withdraw-bid-for-openais-nonprofit-if-its-board-agrees-to-terms\/\">attempts to convert itself from a nonprofit.<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, as a part of these filings, the full <a href=\"https:\/\/www.documentcloud.org\/documents\/25524553-116-1\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">letter of intent<\/a> from Musk\u2019s team to buy OpenAI was made public.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Here are five key details we learned from that letter and other legal filings to shed light on this ongoing, and rather messy, dispute.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-clear-deadline-set\"><strong>Clear deadline set<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The unsolicited offer from Musk\u2019s group comes with a specific expiration date: May 10, 2025.

Regular communication, feedback, and testing are required for the collaboration to work smoothly and deliver a user experience that aligns with the intended design goals.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nick Budden, a serial entrepreneur who used to work as a UI\/UX designer, wanted designers to spend their days solely on design work rather than handoffs or meetings with engineers. To address a few inefficient steps in the design process, Budden founded <a href=\"https:\/\/www.phase.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Phase<\/a> in 2017.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cImplementing UI is an expensive, time-consuming manual process involving designers, product managers, and engineers,\u201d Budden said in an exclusive interview with TechCrunch. \u201cComprehensive user testing is also delayed until after that process is complete.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Taipei- and Berlin-based startup is building a no-code platform that helps UI\/UX designers create fully interactive prototypes, and it said on Thursday that it has raised $13 million in funding from Gobi Partners, Hive Ventures, New Economy Ventures, Palm Drive Capital, Shilling VC, SquareOne, WI Harper, 42CAP, and 500 Global.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Today, the startup released its first product, a UI animation tool that will compete with <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/12\/21\/figma-valuation-after-adobe\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Adobe<\/a> After Effects and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/06\/25\/figma-design-tool-history\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Figma.<\/a> Phase says its software lets UI\/UX and product designers create interactive website or app simulations \u201cwithout manual coding or [using] error-prone AI plugins.\u201d It can also export UI code that\u2019s ready for production, speeding up the design process.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Budden said Phase\u2019s product is much easier for a UI\/UX designer to use than other tools like Adobe After Effects or Figma. \u201cThe key differentiator to Figma is the completeness of the prototype. So in Figma, you can build a prototype that does, maybe 20% or 30% of what the real website does, and then the other 70% or 80% that the prototype doesn\u2019t do; you then have to communicate with the engineers, product managers, and people have to figure that out,\u201d Budden said. \u201cOur product is being built to do 100% of what a real website or app does.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is supposedly the first in a series of launches, and there are plans to introduce three more UI design and code tools of its WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) platform this year and next year to streamline all the manual work required for UI\/UX design, Budden told TechCrunch. The three new features will be UI advanced prototyping, UI design, and UI code export.<\/p>\n<div class=\"marfeel-experience-inline-cta wp-block-tc23-marfeel-experience\">\n<\/div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cWe don\u2019t see UI animation as a stand-alone market for long \u2014 it\u2019s a go-to-market opportunity today, but that window will close once tools like Figma integrate animation as a built-in feature,\u201d Phase\u2019s CEO told TechCrunch. \u201cOur strategy is to gain only initial traction in animation now and move down our roadmap into larger markets before that shift happens.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-soft-launch-in-south-korea\">Soft launch in South Korea<\/h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Phase first introduced its platform in South Korea in May after finding a reliable local partner to help with the launch.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Designers adopt new tools by observing their peers discussing and using them, leading to the widespread adoption of design tools, Budden explained, but he pointed out that this influence is often \u201chyper-local.\u201d For example, designers in London are primarily influenced by others in their area.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cBecause of this local dynamic, we launched region by region, allowing us to engage deeply with each design community and build momentum,\u201d Budden said.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">South Korea has about 100,000 designers, and Phase says that within a few weeks of launching its product, more than 10,000 had tested it. This hands-on approach successfully kick-started community growth \u2014 at least in South Korea \u2014 but it hasn&#8217;t worked out as well as the company hoped in other regions.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cLarger markets had more dispersed design communities, making it harder to gain traction. After months of struggling to re-create Korea\u2019s success, we shifted gears and opened a global beta,\u201d Phase\u2019s CEO said. \u201cWith adjustments to our go-to-market strategy, we saw rapid and sustained growth&nbsp;\u2026 That momentum, combined with product stabilization, is why we\u2019re moving out of beta now.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Phase aims to enter the U.S. and European markets as its next priority.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>UX and UI designers work closely with engineers throughout product development to build and implement design concepts and wireframes for functional user interfaces.

The funds will mainly be used to accelerate the work Archer is doing with Anduril to build a hybrid craft (VTOL).<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The raise brings Archer\u2019s total funding to around $3.36 billion. And as reporter Rebecca Bellan noted, this fresh capital comes off the back of a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2024\/12\/12\/archer-teams-up-with-anduril-and-raises-430-million-to-build-defense-aircraft\/\">$430 million round<\/a> in December to fund its new Archer Defense program.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Reminder: It wasn\u2019t too long ago that Archer\u2019s go-to-market strategy was an air taxi network across several cities in the U.S. and abroad.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Other deals that got my attention&nbsp;\u2026<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Auto Hauler Exchange<\/strong>, the Michigan startup that developed a digital marketplace for vehicle transportation, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.autohaulerexchange.com\/blog\/auto-hauler-exchange-announces-5m-series-a-round-led-by-mhs-capital-to-expand-vehicle-transportation-marketplace\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">raised $5 million<\/a> in a Series A funding round led by MHS Capital. Golden Ventures, which led Auto Hauler Exchange&#8217;s seed round, also invested in the Series A round.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Endera<\/strong>, an electric bus manufacturer in Ohio, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.enderamotors.com\/press-releases\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">raised $49 million<\/a> in equity and debt. The round included a $36 million equity investment led by Magnetar. Pulse Fund also participated. The total also included a $13 million credit facility.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>GreenSpark Software<\/strong>, a New York City-based startup building software for the metal recycling industry, disclosed last month it raised <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20240125140353\/en\/GreenSpark-Announces-9.4-Million-in-New-Funding-To-Expand-Its-Modern-Operating-System-for-the-Metal-Recycling-Industry\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$9.4 million<\/a> from investors Zero Infinity Partners, Third Prime, Bienville Capital, and several unnamed strategic investors. We now know that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bmwusanews.com\/newsrelease.do?id=4518&amp;mid=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">BMW i Ventures<\/a> is one of them.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Innoviz<\/strong>, the lidar company, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/innoviz-announces-pricing-of-40-million-registered-direct-offering-302372319.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">raised $40 million<\/a> from institutional investors at a share price of $1.39 \u2014 a discount that caused its stock price to fall steeply. As of Wednesday, the company\u2019s stock had fallen 37% since its Friday closing price of $1.59.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>JLR<\/strong> is expanding its U.S. technology hub in Portland with a <a href=\"https:\/\/media.jaguarlandrover.com\/en-us\/news\/2024\/02\/jlr-expands-portland-oregon-engineering-hub-state-art-facility-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$180 million investment<\/a> that will be spread out over the next decade. The hub is developing the next generation of connected cars and what it described as \u201cautonomous driving technologies\u201d in future JLR vehicles. History lesson: JLR opened its tech hub in 2014 and expanded the facility in 2016, 2017, and 2024.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Revel<\/strong>, the electric shared moped-turned-EV-charging-infrastructure startup, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2025\/02\/10\/revel-nabs-60m-in-new-york-state-funding-to-build-more-ev-chargers\/\">secured a $60 million loan<\/a> from New York\u2019s clean energy investment fund NY Green Bank to more than triple its current public fast-charging network in New York City.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Self Inspection<\/strong>, a startup based in San Diego that has developed an AI-powered vehicle inspection service, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2025\/02\/07\/self-inspection-raises-3m-for-its-ai-powered-vehicle-inspections\/\">raised $3 million<\/a> in a seed round co-led by Costanoa Ventures and DVx Ventures, the firm <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/podcast\/jon-mcneill-on-vc-2-0-and-creating-startups-in-house\/\">run by former Tesla president Jon McNeill<\/a>.

Lyft isn\u2019t spilling details about which carmaker it will partner with; we do know that Marubeni, a Japanese conglomerate with experience managing fleets, will own and finance the Mobileye-equipped vehicles that will show up on the Lyft app.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Lyft-Mobileye deal got me thinking about Texas. It wasn\u2019t that long ago that California and Arizona were the main hotbeds of robotaxi activity. But Texas is quickly becoming a hub, not just of testing, but also of commercial operations. Austin is one Texas AV hot spot: <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2025\/01\/29\/elon-musk-claims-tesla-will-launch-a-self-driving-service-in-austin-in-june\/\"><strong>Tesla <\/strong>is planning to launch<\/a> its driverless ride-hail service in the city this coming June, and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2025\/02\/05\/waymo-just-popped-up-on-the-uber-app-in-austin-ahead-of-robotaxi-launch\/\"><strong>Waymo<\/strong> and <strong>Uber<\/strong> are set to launch a service soon<\/a>. <strong>Avride<\/strong> has <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2024\/10\/03\/uber-taps-yandex-spinout-avride-for-autonomous-delivery-and-ride-hail-partnership\/\">also set up shop in Austin<\/a>. Meanwhile, self-driving truck companies <strong>Aurora<\/strong> and <strong>Kodiak Robotics<\/strong> also have a footprint in Texas. This <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/11\/16\/the-wild-west-of-robotaxis-will-texas-be-a-regulatory-haven-or-chaos-unleashed\/\">TechCrunch article from 2023<\/a> posed a question that we may finally answer in 2025.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>May Mobility<\/strong> launched its first <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2025\/02\/12\/may-mobility-launches-its-first-driverless-commercial-ride-hail-service\/\">fully driverless commercial service<\/a> in Peachtree Corners, Georgia. May has a different operations strategy than Waymo or Zoox. This isn\u2019t a free-wheeling service that goes anywhere. Instead, it has (for now) eight pre-determined stops.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Waymo<\/strong> continues to expand its robotaxi service areas, this time in Los Angeles. The company has <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/Waymo\/status\/1889349993208705515\">added 10 square miles<\/a> to include Westchester and parts of Inglewood and Crenshaw, giving customers access to popular destinations like SoFi Stadium and HHLA Entertainment.<\/p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-electric-vehicles-charging-amp-batteries\">Electric vehicles, charging, &amp; batteries<\/h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Mercedes-Benz<\/strong> is taking its EV charging network to Canada, starting with Vancouver this year and then to stations in metro Toronto in 2026. The German automaker has 300 charging stalls in operation and under construction in 11 U.S. states.

Here\u2019s a quick breakdown:<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Lyft<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/investor.lyft.com\/news-and-events\/news\/news-details\/2025\/Lyft-Reports-Record-Q4-and-Full-Year-2024-Results\/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reported<\/a> record growth and its first full-year GAAP profitability for 2024 with a net income of $22.8 million, compared to a net loss of $340.3 million in 2023. That\u2019s good news, but investors paid more attention to the company\u2019s lower-than-expected guidance for gross bookings in the first quarter.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lyft says Q1 is just a slower season, but the company also anticipates bookings to be negatively affected by the loss of its partnership with Delta, which Uber has snagged. Another interesting tidbit: Lyft\u2019s board authorized $500 million in share buybacks, the company\u2019s first time doing such a program.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, <strong>Uber<\/strong> beat revenue expectations in the <a href=\"https:\/\/investor.uber.com\/news-events\/news\/press-release-details\/2025\/Uber-Announces-Results-for-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2024\/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">fourth quarter<\/a>, growing its revenue 20% to $11.96 billion. Its adjusted EBITDA was $1.84 billion for Q4 and $6.84 billion for the full year. Still, shares fell after the company reported that it missed analyst expectations on EPS and offered soft guidance.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company expects gross bookings to hit between $42 billion and $43.5 billion in Q1, which would be less than the $44.2 billion Uber recorded in Q4 2024. Uber CFO Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah cited currency headwinds and impact from the recent Los Angeles fires and \u201cextreme weather in January.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-this-week-s-wheels\">This week\u2019s wheels<\/h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This newsletter is getting long, so no this week\u2019s wheels!

is building an omni-channel marketing platform for enterprises"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When EJ Cho started his first company in 2018, he was exposed to what it takes to market a product. He was surprised to find a market filled with different single-use tools.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">&#8220;It was a very frustrating experience,&#8221; Cho told TechCrunch. &#8220;I had to learn and juggle all these different tools. It felt like a very inefficient way of getting your word out to users. I&#8217;ve always been fascinated about how to make marketing a bit more efficient and effective.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cho (pictured above on the left) sat on this idea for a few years while working on engineering teams at companies such as Meta, Affirm, and Fast. After the advancements in generative AI in 2022, he realized he might be able to solve the marketing problems he had years earlier using AI.<br \/><br \/>The result was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tofuhq.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Tofu<\/a>, an AI-driven B2B marketing platform that&#8217;s designed to bring all of a company&#8217;s potential marketing campaigns into one space. The platform integrates with a marketing team&#8217;s existing workflow, and tools like HubSpot and Salesforce, and uses AI to automatically modify marketing copy for different marketing channels and can personalize marketing content for different customer types.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cho, Tofu co-founder and CEO, said that while he ran into his frustrations with marketing tools while building a consumer-facing company, he decided to focus on B2B marketing because it is significantly more text heavy than B2C marketing, which made it a more natural choice for a generative AI approach.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tofu&#8217;s team consulted more than 40 different CMOs before writing any code, Cho said, to figure out what their biggest pain points were. The two areas that came up most consistently were that CMOs wanted to be able to personalize content across different market segments and to repurpose content for different channels. Cho said that&#8217;s where Tofu focused first.<\/p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1826\" height=\"1140\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/Screenshot-2025-02-10-at-12.53.47PM.png?w=680\" alt=\"Tofu,\" class=\"wp-image-2965694\" style=\"width:407px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/Screenshot-2025-02-10-at-12.53.47PM.png 1826w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/Screenshot-2025-02-10-at-12.53.47PM.png?resize=150,94 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/Screenshot-2025-02-10-at-12.53.47PM.png?resize=300,187 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/Screenshot-2025-02-10-at-12.53.47PM.png?resize=768,479 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/Screenshot-2025-02-10-at-12.53.47PM.png?resize=680,425 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/Screenshot-2025-02-10-at-12.53.47PM.png?resize=1200,749 1200w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/Screenshot-2025-02-10-at-12.53.47PM.png?resize=1280,799 1280w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/Screenshot-2025-02-10-at-12.53.47PM.png?resize=430,268 430w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/Screenshot-2025-02-10-at-12.53.47PM.png?resize=720,450 720w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/Screenshot-2025-02-10-at-12.53.47PM.png?resize=900,562 900w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/Screenshot-2025-02-10-at-12.53.47PM.png?resize=800,499 800w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/Screenshot-2025-02-10-at-12.53.47PM.png?resize=1536,959 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/Screenshot-2025-02-10-at-12.53.47PM.png?resize=668,417 668w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/Screenshot-2025-02-10-at-12.53.47PM.png?resize=601,375 601w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/Screenshot-2025-02-10-at-12.53.47PM.png?resize=988,617 988w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/Screenshot-2025-02-10-at-12.53.47PM.png?resize=708,442 708w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1826px) 100vw, 1826px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Tofu combines multiple marketing tools into one using AI. <\/span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong>Tofu (screenshot)<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">&#8220;If you really think about it, there&#8217;s not that much delta between what you want to write for maybe an email versus what&#8217;s for a landing page copy,&#8221; Cho said. &#8220;Obviously there&#8217;s these small nuances, but it&#8217;s nothing that cannot be embedded under one tool.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">San Francisco-based Tofu launched in late 2023 and has seen strong demand. The company boasts 12x revenue growth, although it&#8217;s worth noting that it&#8217;s only been in operation for a little over a year. Customers include DeepScribe, Check Point, and Wunderkind, among others.<\/p>\n<div class=\"marfeel-experience-inline-cta wp-block-tc23-marfeel-experience\">\n<\/div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is announcing a $12 million Series A round led by SignalFire with participation from HubSpot Ventures, Tau Ventures, and Correlation Ventures, among a number of existing VC investors and angel investors.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Using AI in marketing is not necessarily a new concept \u2014\u00a0nor a post-ChatGPT concept, either. <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/10\/18\/ai-content-platform-jasper-raises-125m-at-a-1-7b-valuation\/\">Jasper<\/a>, which helps enterprise companies with AI-driven marketing, has been around for a decade and is valued at more than $1.5 billion. <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/07\/26\/cordial-which-personalizes-and-automates-cross-channel-messaging-campaigns-raises-50m\/\">Cordial<\/a>, another cross-channel marketing platform, has raised more than $70 million in venture funding.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cho acknowledged that the space is crowded but added that he thinks Tofu is in a good position because it touches so many different teams within a marketing department, compared to a single-use tool. That makes it stickier than some of Tofu&#8217;s other competitors, he said. The fact that Tofu isn&#8217;t just a ChatGPT wrapper and offers an integrated end-to-end solution makes them stand out, he added.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now that Tofu has closed its Series A round, the company is going expand the product&#8217;s capabilities as it works toward building a source of truth for marketing teams.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">&#8220;It is a noisy space,&#8221; Cho said. &#8220;The way we position ourselves is to basically say we replace and can support the multiple use cases you&#8217;re purchasing individual tools for with one platform. So that unified platform is a very appealing value proposition for customers, especially enterprise customers.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When EJ Cho started his first company in 2018, he was exposed to what it takes to market a product.

It also said that it was <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2024\/01\/25\/openai-responds-to-congressional-black-caucus-about-lack-of-diversity-on-its-board\/\">serious about this work<\/a> and was committed to \u201ccontinuously improving our work in creating a diverse, equitable, and inclusive organization,\u201d as captured by the Internet Web Archive and also as cited <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2023\/12\/15\/tech\/openai-board-diversity\/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">by a 2023 CNN article<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It isn\u2019t clear exactly when this change was made, but there\u2019s some evidence it was very recent. The diversity commitment web page <a href=\"https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/US\/tech-firms-trumps-ai-stargate-venture-touted-dei\/story?id=117996988\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">was cited as available by an ABC News story<\/a> published on January 22. By January 27, OpenAI <a href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/btibor91\/status\/1883855755436245201\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">had published<\/a> the new, replacement \u201cbuilding dynamic teams&#8221; web page.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new page says, \u201cAt OpenAI, we recognize that the strongest ideas emerge when they are tested, debated, and improved by people with different backgrounds, experiences, and ways of thinking. We encourage a culture of curiosity where ideas can be challenged \u2014 not just accepted.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI did not immediately respond to our request for comment about the website change or if it indicates any of the company&#8217;s internal processes have been rolled back or altered. OpenAI\u2019s web page that <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https:\/\/openai.com\/index\/evaluating-fairness-in-chatgpt\/\">promises \u201cfairness\u201d<\/a> in model training to remove social biases is still live, for instance.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI is hardly the only company to distance itself from the wording of DEI as these specific words \u2014 as well as the concepts behind them \u2014 face fierce political and legal backlash these days. Last week, Attorney General Pam Bondi <a href=\"https:\/\/www.justice.gov\/ag\/media\/1388501\/dl?inline\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">instructed<\/a> the Department of Justice to \u201cinvestigate, eliminate, and penalize,\u201d DEI programs deemed illegal in private sector companies that receive federal funds.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the past month, Meta, Google, and Amazon have all announced the elimination or adjustment of DEI policies, with the latter two <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2025\/02\/07\/amazon-deletes-inclusion-and-diversity-language-in-latest-filing\/\">scrubbing mention<\/a> of diversity and inclusion from their recent 10-K forms.\u00a0<\/p>\n<div class=\"marfeel-experience-inline-cta wp-block-tc23-marfeel-experience\">\n<\/div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI is working with the government in a few capacities.

Seagate will initially purchase a minimum of &#8220;at least one share more than 50%&#8221; of Intevac\u2019s issued and outstanding shares,&nbsp;and then execute a &#8220;second step&#8221; merger to acquire the company&#8217;s remaining shares.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Intevac\u2019s board of directors and largest shareholders unanimously approved the transaction. Seagate expects it to close in late March or early April, subject to customary closing conditions.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Santa Clara-based Intevac, founded in 1991 as a spin-off from tech firm Varian Associates, manufactures thin film deposition systems. It IPO&#8217;d in 1995, and has expanded its footprint over the years to territories including China, Malaysia, and Singapore.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On its website, Intavec says its products support hard drive disk media production and the upgrade of existing hard drive systems. One of the technologies that the firm touts as its preferred solution, heat-assisted magnetic recording, or HAMR, improves the &#8220;writeability&#8221; and storage density of hard drives by applying heat energy.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It&#8217;s not tough to see how this fits squarely into Seagate&#8217;s hard drive disk business. In December, Seagate <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2024\/12\/18\/24324143\/seagate-32tb-hamr-hard-drive\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announced<\/a> its first HAMR-based hard drive after a two-decade hiatus from the tech, and the company plans to ship HAMR-based drives to several customers, including a &#8220;leading cloud provider,&#8221; this year.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Several of Seagate&#8217;s rivals, including Western Digital and Toshiba, are also working on HAMR-based drives, spurred by the growing worldwide demand for storage. HAMR-based drives generally have a cost advantage over incumbent solid-state technologies, making them especially attractive to public cloud vendors.<\/p>\n<div class=\"marfeel-experience-inline-cta wp-block-tc23-marfeel-experience\">\n<\/div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Intavec&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/quote\/IVAC\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">market cap was around $91.17 million<\/a> as of Thursday. In its most recent fiscal quarter (Q3 2024), the firm notched $28.5 million in revenue, up 59% year-over-year, but posted a $2.17 million net loss.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Intavec late last year <a href=\"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/intevac-provides-cash-revenue-guidance-133000646.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">said<\/a> it was exploring &#8220;strategic options&#8221; and undergoing a restructuring that the company anticipated would &#8220;materially strengthen its profitability.&#8221; One of those strategic options was an exit from the public markets, it seems.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Intavec is Seagate&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/tracxn.com\/d\/acquisitions\/acquisitions-by-seagate\/__PHvysLHNPgGJX1Zfuz0N9tqrn0Uj9RAxmOXRJQcnSoo#list-of-acquisitions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">first major acquisition<\/a> since the company bought Kioxia, a supplier of flash memory and solid-state drives, in 2017.

In 2023, <a href=\"http:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/07\/27\/hackers-are-infecting-call-of-duty-players-with-a-self-spreading-malware\/\">hackers were found infecting players<\/a> of an old Call of Duty

partnership with Apple that\u2019s set to bring AI features to iPhones sold in China. The deal is an important one for Apple, as iPhone sales have dropped precipitously in the world\u2019s largest smartphone market. The handset experienced an 11% year-over-year drop in China, according to Apple\u2019s<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2025\/01\/30\/apple-quarterly-revenue-increases-even-as-china-sales-decline-11\/\"> most recent earnings report<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Apple \u201ctalked to a number of companies in China,\u201d Alibaba chairperson Joseph Tsai said Thursday during Dubai\u2019s World Government Summit. \u201cIn the end they chose to do business with us. They want to use our AI to power their phones. We feel extremely honored to do business with a great company like Apple.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to reports, Apple&#8217;s<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theinformation.com\/articles\/apple-hits-snags-adapting-baidus-ai-models-for-china-users\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"> earlier deal with China\u2019s Baidu<\/a> has been plagued with issues adapting the search giant&#8217;s AI offering. Apple is also believed to have explored partnerships with ByteDance and DeepSeek, prior to settling on Alibaba. These sorts of partnerships are key to U.S. companies like Apple as they work for regulatory approval in China. Both Alibaba and Apple have reportedly submitted relevant materials to local authorities.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ahead of the company&#8217;s most recent earnings call, CEO Tim Cook cited the absence of Apple Intelligence, the company\u2019s in-house generative AI solution, as a contributing factor in slowing international sales.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\u201cDuring the December quarter, we saw that in markets where we had rolled out Apple Intelligence, that the year-over-year performance on the iPhone 16 family was stronger than those markets where we had not rolled out Apple intelligence,\u201d the executive<a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2025\/01\/30\/apple-points-to-fiscal-stimulus-after-steep-china-sales-decline.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"> told CNBC<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has banked on Apple Intelligence to drive the next major iPhone \u201csuper cycle\u201d &#8212; a term referring to a dramatic uptick in device sales. Apple\u2019s speed and strategy in rolling out its own generative AI solution hampered its growth, as Google continues to deliver new Gemini features by way of Samsung phones, Pixel devices, and various other Android offerings.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Increased domestic competition has also eaten into Apple\u2019s China market share. Vivo took the lead in the fourth quarter of last year, with 17% of the market, according to<a href=\"https:\/\/canalys.com\/newsroom\/china-smartphone-market-q4-2024\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"> figures<\/a> from research firm Canalys. Huawei, which has seen a massive rebound following sanctions from the first Trump administration, grew shipments 37% year over year, scoring a second-place finish at 16% market share. Apple, which commanded 24% of the market the same time last year, dropped to 15%, putting it in a third-place dead heat with Xiaomi and Oppo.<\/p>\n<div class=\"marfeel-experience-inline-cta wp-block-tc23-marfeel-experience\">\n<\/div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Apple is banking on the Alibaba deal to help regain some of that market, but even if the partnership passes regulatory scrutiny, Apple&#8217;s China future isn&#8217;t crystal clear. Tariffs and trade tensions are likely to further impact sales in the key market.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has notably been cozying up to Donald Trump during the president&#8217;s second term.<a href=\"https:\/\/www.axios.com\/2025\/01\/03\/tim-cook-apple-donate-1-million-trump-inauguration\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"> Cook donated<\/a> $1 million to Trump&#8217;s inaugural committee in January. More recently, Apple followed Google&#8217;s lead by changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2025\/02\/11\/apple-maps-plans-to-show-gulf-of-america-following-google\/\"> on its Maps app<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch has reached out to Apple for additional comment on the Alibaba deal.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>TechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter!&nbsp;<\/em><em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/newsletters\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Sign up here<\/a><\/em><em>&nbsp;to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Alibaba on Thursday confirmed recent reports of a partnership with Apple that\u2019s set to bring AI features to iPhones sold in China.
