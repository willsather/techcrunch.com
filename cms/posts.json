It was previously a public company until PE firm Thoma Bravo took it private in 2022, valuing it at $6.9 billion at the time. The private equity giant is still the majority owner.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"\u003EThis was a leveraged-buyout company as an IPO, not a classic venture-backed startup. VC-backed startups going public often have the kind of growth potential that excites investors, as was the case with ServiceTitan.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"\u003EOn the positive side for SailPoint, the company priced its initial 60 million shares at $23, above its previously announced range of $19 and $21. SailPoint raked in over $1.3 billion, which it will use for operations and to pay off about $1.5 billion of debt it showed on its books, according to a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2030781/000119312525019604/d885522ds1a.htm#rom885522_7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"\u003Eregulatory filing\u003C/a\u003E. It&#8217;s also at about a $13 billion market cap, a boost from what Thoma Bravo paid.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"\u003E&#8220;In no way did we consider this a disappointing IPO. We went from mid-point of $20&nbsp;to a close of $25 on Day 2. In our minds, it&#8217;s a very successful IPO,&#8221; CEO Mark McClain told TechCrunch.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"\u003EStill, the upshot for those looking for a sign that IPOs could be flowing again soon (especially employees of late-stage startups looking at their paper-money stock and stock options): the signals remain murky.\u003C/p\u003E\n",

He said hundreds of people have RSVP’d to the various events so far, and that more are popping up each day. Winter also said he’s even heard from people who are planning them internationally.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"\u003EThe protests are about more than shaping optics and building community, Winter said. Musk’s vast wealth is in large part tied to his ownership of about 20% of Tesla’s stock. That makes him somewhat vulnerable to large swings in the company’s stock price &#8212; doubly so because he has borrowed an incredible amount of money against those shares. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"\u003EWhile the exact dollar amount is unknown, as of an April 2024 regulatory filing, Musk had used nearly 60% of all the Tesla shares he owned at the time \u003Ca href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000110465924053333/tm2326076d15_def14a.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"\u003Eas collateral for loans\u003C/a\u003E. Theoretically, if Tesla’s stock price were to sink low enough, Musk’s lenders could demand he pay back what’s still owed, or at least make him renegotiate their terms.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"\u003E“The long goal is to devalue, to create a vote of no confidence in the company&#8217;s future, and to prompt a widespread selling of shares, which would legitimately hurt him,” he said. “But I also see enormous value in just the public-facing activist education and literacy aspect of this.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"\u003EWinter’s background makes him well-prepared for that education effort. He’s made documentaries about the Panama Papers (a project that exposed financial crime and corruption around the globe), and the potential harms of YouTube’s algorithmic feed. He is also involved in the “\u003Ca href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/13/free-our-feeds-campaign-aims-to-billionaire-proof-blueskys-tech/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003EFree our Feeds\u003C/a\u003E” initiative, which is an effort to build an open social media system on Bluesky’s AT Protocol.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"\u003EWith that in mind, it’s no surprise he said he’s been concerned about Musk’s influence over tech for years.&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"\u003EDonovan said she believes Musk is “really leveraging the fact that many Americans are ignorant of how the government actually works” while spreading this misinformation. She worries that it will lead to violence &#8212; especially as Musk and his supporters single out government workers, judges, and their family members. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"\u003EThat’s another reason why Donovan said she wants people to get out and protest.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"\u003E“My hope is that people come together, acting locally but thinking globally at these protests, and find other more local ways to resist,” Donovan said. “I think one of the things that Musk has overlooked is that power isn&#8217;t derived from the federal government, power is derived from the states, and there&#8217;s a lot that different state agencies can do to rein in the power of the federal government to force accountability.”\u003C/p\u003E\n",

Tesla shareholders voted Thursday to grant Elon Musk's $56 billion compensation package for 2018, despite a US judge's order in January to rescind it. At Tesla's 2024 annual stockholder meeting held in Austin, Texas on Thursday, shareholders also voted in favor of Musk's proposal to move Tesla's incorporation to Texas, where the carmaker's biggest US factory is located, from Delaware, where most publicly traded firms are incorporated.
